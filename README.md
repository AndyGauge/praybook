# praybook

## Purpose
praybook is a prayer tracking website.  Users are created by signing up and logging in.  Email and passwords provide authentication.  No email is delivered to the users.  Answered prayer is converted into praise.

praybook will become a social network prayer sharing application, allowing users to include each other in their prayers, with information flow allowing those prayed for to indicate the prayer is answered.

## Semantic Versioning
Current version of website is 0.2.0.  The website is in pre-alpha development.  Most everything does not work.  0.1.0 was launched with support for log in, and 0.2.0 marks the ability to navigate and create prayers.

### Future version plans: 
0.2.1 Prayers allow editing
0.2.2 Prayers can be completed
0.3.0 Render Praise
1.0.0 fully functioning website, launch
2.0.0 fully functioning social website, launch
